Description: Likelihood-based inference for series systems with masked
    component cause of failure, using arbitrary dynamic failure rate (DFR)
    component distributions. Computes log-likelihood, score, Hessian, and
    MLE for masked data satisfying conditions C1, C2, C3 under general
    component hazard functions.
